# Case

Utilities for upper and lower case of Unicode strings.

This code uses a very compact encoding of the upper- and lower-case
information from Unicode.  It is intended to be compact enough for
embedded devices.

This code was originally from the Dartino project and has
been ported to Toit by Toitware.
